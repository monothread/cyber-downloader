# Publishing a new version

The app updates itself (via `electron-updater`) from the **public Releases** of
`github.com/monothread/cyber-downloader`. Configuration lives in `electron-builder.yml` (`publish`).

## Step by step (all platforms)
1. Bump the version in `package.json` (semver; the app only offers versions **greater** than the installed one).
2. Run the checks: `npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json`, `npx eslint src/ test/ --max-warnings=0`, `npx vitest run`, `npm run test:e2e`.
3. Push `main` to GitHub (`git push origin main`). Releases are built from the code that is on GitHub.
4. **Linux packages** (AppImage, deb, rpm for Fedora, pacman for Arch), pick one:
   - Locally: `sudo apt install rpm libarchive-tools zstd` once, then `export GH_TOKEN=<token>` and `npm run release`.
   - On GitHub: Actions tab → **Release Linux** → *Run workflow* (no token needed, it uses the repository's own).
5. **Windows installer:** Actions tab → **Release Windows** → *Run workflow*.
6. Each run uploads its files to the **draft** Release `v<version>` (creating it if needed): Linux uploads `cyber-downloader-<version>.{AppImage,deb,rpm,pacman}` and `latest-linux.yml`; Windows uploads `cyber-downloader-<version>-setup.exe` and `latest.yml`. Wait until every run you started has finished.
7. On GitHub, open the draft Release, check the assets and click **Publish release**. Drafts are **not** seen by installed apps.
8. In the Release notes, mention where the FFmpeg source code can be found (Linux: https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/, Windows: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/; GPLv3).

Rules that keep the updater working:
- Publish the Release only **after** all platforms were uploaded.
- Do not build Linux both locally and on GitHub for the same version: both upload `latest-linux.yml` and the last one wins.

`npm run dist` (Linux) and `npm run dist:win` (a Windows machine) generate the same files in `dist/` **without publishing**.

## How the app updates
- On startup (if "Check for updates on startup" is on, 5 s after opening) and via the **CHECK FOR UPDATES** button in Settings.
- If a newer version exists, a yellow banner appears with **UPDATE TO x.y.z** → downloads (only the changed blocks) → **RESTART & INSTALL**.
- Installing takes a separate click on purpose: restarting interrupts downloads in progress.
- **AppImage:** replaces its own file (needs write permission where the file lives).
- **.deb, .rpm and .pacman:** `electron-updater` uses the system package manager (apt/dpkg, dnf/rpm, pacman) and asks for a password (polkit/pkexec).
- **Windows:** the NSIS installer updates itself silently for the current user; releases are unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on the first install.
- In development (`npm run dev`) the app shows "Updates are only available in the installed app.".
- With no Release published yet, the check shows "No published versions on GitHub" — that is expected before the first one.

## Things to keep in mind
- The repository must be **public** (the app does not carry a token).
- The bundled yt-dlp has its own update mechanism (the "UPDATE YT-DLP" button), independent of the app version.
- ffmpeg and deno only change when you rebuild the package (`npm run fetch-binaries -- --force`) and release a new version.
- Code signing is not required on Linux. On Windows it is optional, but unsigned installers trigger a SmartScreen warning.

## Troubleshooting
- **`npm run release` stops with "Missing tools needed to build the rpm and pacman packages":** install what it lists (`sudo apt install rpm libarchive-tools zstd` on Ubuntu) or use the **Release Linux** workflow.
- **A Windows or Linux workflow run created a second draft:** the draft is matched by tag; if it was already published, unpublish it or delete the extra draft and run again before publishing.
- **The app says "No published versions on GitHub" or never shows the banner:** the Release is still a draft. Publish it, then confirm with
  `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/monothread/cyber-downloader/releases/latest | grep -E '"tag_name"|"name"'`.
- **403 "Resource not accessible by personal access token" on `npm run release`:** the token cannot write Releases. Use a fine-grained token with *Contents: Read and write* on this repository (repository access must be "Only select repositories"), or a classic token with the `repo` scope.
- **The upload looks stuck:** electron-builder prints nothing while uploading ~470 MB; check the Assets of the draft Release on GitHub.
- **Installed version < new version but no banner:** an app older than 0.1.1 crashes with `write EPIPE` when opened from a file manager; open it from a terminal or download the new file manually.
